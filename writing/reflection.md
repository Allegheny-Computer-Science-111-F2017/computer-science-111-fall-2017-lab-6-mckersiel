# Reflection by Liam McKersie

This lab required me to write a file called `ManipulateDNA`. Lab six was the
most difficult lab thus far. The section that was most difficult to work
through was step three. We were required to insert a randomly chosen DNA letter
into the DNA String. Eventually, I used variables int and char to help proceed.

I defined the int "randomInsertionIndex" as the variable that would represent
where the randomly chosen DNA letter would fit into the string. Additionally I
learned that it was necessary to use a "new Random" method to ensure that the
DNA letter that is selected in each case is truly ranodm.

Configuring a strategy to manipulate the DNA String was not simple. If I wrote
commands to compute the complement of the DNA String, the DNA characters would
swap twice and remain in their original places. I realized this was because I
was replacing one upper case letter with another upper case letter. This forced
me to command an upper case letter to swap with a lower case letter. With my
new adjustment, the DNA letters only swapped once and remained in their
randomized locations. Overall, lab six forced me to think on the fly and
creatively adjust to errors. I am looking forward to applying my abilities to
lab seven.
